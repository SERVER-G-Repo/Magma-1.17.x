## About

Magma is the next generation of hybrid minecraft server softwares.

Magma is based on Forge and Paper, meaning it can run both Craftbukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins and Forge mods.

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Magma experience with support for newer 1.12+ versions of Minecraft.
